This is a cartoon series pitting eight cartoon stereotypes in a pseudo reality TV environment.I have watched all three seasons (only three are on DVD), and this one is the funniest overall. All three are worth a watch, this one is best. The average price of this box set, here on Amazon,  makes it an affordable laugh.While it is possible to start watching with any season of this show, I almost always recommend starting with season one; not too much sequential  story line.
This is parody/satirical humor. This type of humor is not for everyone. The smarter you are the more jokes you will understand; some jokes are subtle. 
Overall, really like the series. Yeah drawn together is great when it comes to the crude humor. The first season was hilarious but sometimes i found the second season lacking. But it still was a great season. A definite buy is you're a fan of crude humor and hilarious cartoons.
