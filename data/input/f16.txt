There was nothing on the third or fourth planes, but on the fifth I spotted
three sentries prowling around in midair, just beyond the lip of the garden wall.
They were a dull yellow all over, each one formed of three muscular legs that rotated
on a hub of gristle. Above the hub was a blobby mass, which sported two
mouths and several watchful eyes. The creatures passed at random back and forth
around the perimeter of the garden. I shrank back against the trunk of the beech
tree instinctively, but I knew they were unlikely to spot me from there. At this distance
I would look like a blackbird on all seven planes. It was when I got closer that
they might break through my illusion.
The sixth plane was clear. But the seventh... that was curious. I couldn't see
anything obvious—the house, the street, the night all looked unchanged—but, call
it intuition if you like, I was sure something was present there, lurking.
I rubbed my beak doubtfully against a knot of wood. As expected, there was a
good deal of powerful magic at work here. I'd heard of Lovelace. He was considered
a formidable magician and a hard taskmaster. I was lucky I had never been
called up in his service, and I did not much want his enmity or that of his servants.
But I had to obey that kid.
The soggy blackbird took off from the branch and swooped across the road,
conveniently avoiding the arc of light from the nearest lamp. It landed in a patch of
scrubby grass at the corner of the wall. Four black trash bags had been left out
there for collection the next morning. The blackbird hopped behind the bags. A cat
that had observed the bird[2] from some way off waited a few moments for it to
emerge, lost patience, and scuttled curiously after it. Behind the bags it discovered
no bird, black or otherwise. There was nothing there but a freshly turned molehill.
