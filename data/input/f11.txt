I truly love the humor of South Park. It's social/political commentary and satirical wit and bathroom absurdity rules. No holds barred! I live to breathe another day in anticipation of Trey Parker's next installment, whether it be South Park or some other venture. South Park is truly the work of a genius. Thank you, Sir Parker. (In Britian they often \"knight\" certian individuals (usually after they are \"old\" or \"dead\") for their contributions to their society) :)Sometimes it is dry. Sometimes it is wet. And sometimes it is too moist for humor. But somebody has to do it!I would like to see new South Park episodes until the day I leave this mortal existence. However, I know that Sir Parker would want to \"move on\". However, I would much like to see South Park from the eyes of a 90 year old Trey Parker. What wisdom would we see then?
