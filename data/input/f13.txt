Seems like today's generation is getting revenge on the censorship from the pastand is trying to open up all cans of worms. I guess nice cartoons with good storiesand some morals are out and crude in your face stuff is in.  Some of these arereally funny, have funny situations but its not for everybody and i would'nt let youngkids see it as you have male and female full frontal...characters urinating andother weird stuff....and also the writters must be gay...cause theres a lot ofgay situations...  But what would you expect from a generation of Reality show watchers.....Hope the next generation of cartoons brings back quality instead of quantity of crap.
I dont agree with the reviewer who says the show wears thin after awhile. Ive watched each show about 3-5 times a piece and I cant get enough of the show, its a very funny and probably one of the best cartoons on tv today. I dont know how ratings are doing for the show but if they release them via dvd, i'll keep on buying them. Xandir and Tim, Sitting in a Tree is my favorite of the season but all the shows are funny. The more you watch, the more you pick up the little stuff you might have missed. Highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys adult cartoons, its much better then South Park.
